              Open the Recipes tab and tap the <strong>+</strong> button. You
              can add a name, description, cover image, ingredients, directions,

            <p>
              Absolutely. The <strong>Records</strong> tab lets you log food

              Yes, privacy is a core principle of Platify. All your data
              (nutrition records, recipes, settings, and personal goals) is
              stored entirely on your device. Nothing is sent to our servers
              unless you actively choose to share a recipe publicly. Only those
              public recipes are stored on our server so other users can
              discover them. You can read more in our
              <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.
